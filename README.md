#  RAFT : Real-time Adaptive Flow Transport 🚦


##  Overview 🌍
RAFT is an AI-driven traffic management system designed to improve urban mobility in Thoothukudi. By utilizing **real-time data, predictive analytics, and edge computing**, RAFT optimizes traffic flow, reduces congestion, and enhances road safety.

##  Features ✨
- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring** – Continuously tracks congestion patterns.
- **AI-powered Signal Optimization** – Uses Swarm AI for adaptive signal timing.
- **Emergency Lane Allocation** – Ensures swift movement for ambulances and police vehicles.
- **Automated Violation Detection** – AI-powered CCTV & ANPR issue e-challans in real-time.

##  Tech Stack 🛠
- **AI & ML**: Swarm AI, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), YOLO (Object Detection)
- **Computer Vision**: Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), AI-enhanced CCTV
- **Web & Mobile**: Interactive dashboard for traffic management and citizen reports

##  Getting Started 🚀
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
